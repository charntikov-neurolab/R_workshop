# Simulating datasets

There are many ways to simulate factorial datasets. We will use a step-by-step approach to make sure that you are getting familiar with every aspect of datasets based on factorial design. 

## The concept behind creating a single level of a dataset.

## Combining multiple data frames representing each levels of a factor into a single dataset.

Below I am simulating a dataset with a factor "dose" which has 4 levels (control, low, medium, and high) and response (dependent) variable "dv".

Step 1: create data for the first level of your factor Attention: everything after a # is a comment and is not a part of a code required to construct a dataset.

```{r}
subject<-(1:10) # create a vector with subject numbers
subject # verify vector

level<-replicate(10, "control") # create a vector of level labels
level # verify vector

# create a vector with response variable
dv<-rnorm(10, mean=10, sd=1) 
# here you can set desired number of subjects, mean, and sd for that level.
dv # verify vector

#combine vectors (subject, level, dv) into a dataframe
df1<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv)
df1 # verify data frame
```




Step 2: Repeat process with modifications to create data for the second level of your factor}

```{r}
subject<-(1:10)
subject

level<-replicate(10, "low") # change to another level
level

dv<-rnorm(10, mean=23, sd=3) 
# change to reflect the effect (higher or lower responding; more or less variance). 
# Here you are in control of your effects. Think how you want to play this out.
dv

df2<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv) # combine to another df
df



```



Step 3: Repeat process with modifications to create data for the third level of your factor

```{r}
subject<-(1:10)
# change to appropriate subject number. 
# Same if within subjects, different if between subjects
subject

level<-replicate(10, "medium") # change to another level
level

dv<-rnorm(10, mean=42, sd=5) 
# change to reflect the effect (higher or lower responding; more or less variance). 
# Here you are in control of your effects. Think how you want to play this out.
dv

df3<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv) # combine to another df
df3



```



Step 4: Repeat process with modifications to create data for the third level of your factor

```{r}
subject<-(1:10)
subject

level<-replicate(10, "high") # change to another level
level

dv<-rnorm(10, mean=80, sd=10)
# change to reflect the effect (higher or lower responding; more or less variance). 
# Here you are in control of your effects. Think how you want to play this out.
dv

df4<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv)
df4


```




Merge data frames into one dataset

```{r}
df<-rbind(df1, df2, df3, df4)
df # verify complete dataset

```

## Data summaries | Descriptive statistics

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Get summary for a complete dataset
summary(df) 


# Get a bit expand look at your data

# Use Hmisc package

library(Hmisc)
describe(df)

# Use psych package

library(psych)
describe(df) # Nice output with sds, ses, and means


# Use 

library(Rmisc)
summarySE(df, measurevar="dv", groupvar="dose") # really good for visualizing with error bars



```



## Within versus between subjects designs


Below is an example of dataset structure for within and between subject designs. Please note differences in subject columns. In the dataset modeling within subjects design, each subject is exposed to each level of a factor (low, med, and high). On the other hand, in the dataset modeling between subject design, each subject is exposed only once to one of the levels of a factor (low, med, or high).


## Visualizing factorial data

Attention:} everything after a # is a comment and is not a part of a code required to construct a dataset. 

Attention:} the very first bracket ">"} is to show a console prompt. This very first bracket is not a part of a code. If you are writing these commands in the text editor you do not need to include them as a part of your code.


Here is the code to visualize data from the example above (df). The conceptual progression of steps used to visualize this data is presented in figure format at the end of this section. 

First lets install ggplot2} package to make pretty figures.

> install.packages("ggplot2") # you only need to install any package once 

> library(ggplot2)

### Boxplot

Let's use "ggplot" function to visualize our data using boxplots.

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot package so we can use ggplot() function

ggplot(df, aes(factor(dose), dv)) + # creates empty plot\\
	geom_boxplot() + # to create boxplots on the plot\\
	geom_jitter() # this will visualize every data point on the plot
```



The box plot (a.k.a. box and whisker diagram) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

Line, point, and error bars}

Let's load additional package to help us with error bars.

> install.packages("Rmisc") # you only need to install any package once

Now let's get standard errors for our dataset

```{r}
library(Rmisc) # load Rmisc package so we can use summarySE() function

dfse <- summarySE(df, measurevar="dv", groupvars=c("dose")) # get standard errors for df
dfse # let's see if we got those se (standard errors for each mean)


# Now let's visualize our data using line, point, and error bar.

ggplot(dfse, aes(x=dose, y=dv, group=1)) +
			geom_line() +
			geom_point() +
			geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=dv-se, ymax=dv+se), width=.1)

```



### Barplot

Let's use "ggplot" function to visualize our data using a barplot. We will use the same dataset that includes means for each condition and standard error (se) for each condition (see figures below for more details).

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot package so we can use ggplot() function

ggplot(dfse, aes(x=dose, y=dv)) + 
			geom_bar(stat="identity") +
			geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=dv-se, ymax=dv+se), width=.1)
```



### Saving figures from RStudio

1. To save figure from RStudio: find and click "Export" above the figure.
2. Choose format, destination, and/or size and save.

### Choosing figure format

What is best for my data?

* line connecting points often used for within subjects designs
* boxplots and barplots are often used for between subject designs

4. Simulating factorial design dataset. Please simulate a dataset from the following hypothetical experiment:

In this experiment human subjects come to the race track. At the race track participants are asked to complete an obstacle course task driving a mid-size sedan car. 30 min prior to the driving task, participants drink 0, 1, 3, or 5 standard alcohol drinks. Each participants comes to the track once a week on the weekend until they experience all 4 alcohol conditions. At the end of the driving task experimenter logs a number of traffic cones, that used to outline each obstacle, knocked down by each driver. There were total 12 subjects that participated in this experiment. 

* Please simulate the dataset as you think it should reflect the results of this experiment.
* Please make sure that variance in each condition is different from other conditions.
* Please visualize the results of this experience as you see fit.

5. Simulating factorial design dataset. Please simulate a dataset from the following hypothetical experiment:

In this experiment four groups of participants are given experimental drug that was designed to enhance performance of troops facing sleep deprivation conditions. In this experiment all subjects are first sleep deprived for 36 hours and then are asked to complete an obstacle course task driving a mid-size sedan car. 1 hour prior to the driving task participants are given 0, 10, 50, or 200 mg of this experimental drug and then asked to drive through the obstacle course. At the end of the driving task experimenter logs a number of traffic cones, that used to outline each obstacle, knocked down by each driver. There
were 32 total participants (8 subjects per group).

* Please simulate the dataset as you think it should reflect the results of this experiment.
* Please make sure that variance in each condition is different from other conditions.
* Please visualize the results of this experience as you see fit.
