<h1>Software</h1>


<p>R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we will use RStudio.</p>

<p>The following software is required for this workshop:</p>

<h2>R [Free]: The R Project for Statistical Computing.</h2> 

<p>1. Download R for your platform here: <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/">https://cloud.r-project.org/</a></p>

<p>2. Install</p> 

<h2> RStudio [Free]: A powerful and productive user interface for R. It's free and open source, and works great on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</h2>

<p>1. Download and install: <li><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download </a></li></p>
<p>Attention: Download and install R FIRST! from the link above.</p>


<h3>Attention Mac users!</h3> 

<p>Some functions in R require an "X11 Server" and/or libraries associated with an X11 server. Apple does not provide this software with OS X anymore so you have to do it on your own via a third-party application called XQuartz.</p>

<p>1. Please close all the programs.</p>

<p>2. Go to <li><a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a></li> and download the top-most "quick download" disk image file.</p>

<p>3. Double click the downloaded disk image then double click on the XQuartz.pkg and follow the installation steps.</p>

<p>4. Please restart your machine.</p>
