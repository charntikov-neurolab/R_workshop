# Simulating datasets

There are many ways to simulate factorial datasets. We will use a step-by-step approach to make sure that you are getting familiar with every aspect of datasets based on factorial design. 

## The concept behind creating a single level of a dataset.

## Combining multiple data frames representing each levels of a factor into a single dataset.

Below I am simulating a dataset with a factor "dose" which has 4 levels (control, low, medium, and high) and response (dependent) variable "dv".

Step 1: create data for the first level of your factor Attention: everything after a # is a comment and is not a part of a code required to construct a dataset.

```{r}
subject<-(1:10) # create a vector with subject numbers
subject # verify vector

level<-replicate(10, "control") # create a vector of level labels
level # verify vector

# create a vector with response variable
dv<-rnorm(10, mean=10, sd=1) 
# here you can set desired number of subjects, mean, and sd for that level.
dv # verify vector

#combine vectors (subject, level, dv) into a dataframe
df1<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv)
df1 # verify data frame
```




Step 2: Repeat process with modifications to create data for the second level of your factor}

```{r}
subject<-(1:10)
subject

level<-replicate(10, "low") # change to another level
level

dv<-rnorm(10, mean=23, sd=3) 
# change to reflect the effect (higher or lower responding; more or less variance). 
# Here you are in control of your effects. Think how you want to play this out.
dv

df2<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv) # combine to another df
df



```



Step 3: Repeat process with modifications to create data for the third level of your factor

```{r}
subject<-(1:10)
# change to appropriate subject number. 
# Same if within subjects, different if between subjects
subject

level<-replicate(10, "medium") # change to another level
level

dv<-rnorm(10, mean=42, sd=5) 
# change to reflect the effect (higher or lower responding; more or less variance). 
# Here you are in control of your effects. Think how you want to play this out.
dv

df3<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv) # combine to another df
df3



```



Step 4: Repeat process with modifications to create data for the third level of your factor

```{r}
subject<-(1:10)
subject

level<-replicate(10, "high") # change to another level
level

dv<-rnorm(10, mean=80, sd=10)
# change to reflect the effect (higher or lower responding; more or less variance). 
# Here you are in control of your effects. Think how you want to play this out.
dv

df4<-data.frame(subject=subject, dose=level, dv=dv)
df4


```




Merge data frames into one dataset

```{r}
df<-rbind(df1, df2, df3, df4)
df # verify complete dataset
summary(df) # get summary for a complete dataset
```



## Within versus between subjects designs


Below is an example of dataset structure for within and between subject designs. Please note differences in subject columns. In the dataset modeling within subjects design, each subject is exposed to each level of a factor (low, med, and high). On the other hand, in the dataset modeling between subject design, each subject is exposed only once to one of the levels of a factor (low, med, or high).


## Visualizing factorial data

Attention:} everything after a # is a comment and is not a part of a code required to construct a dataset. 

Attention:} the very first bracket ">"} is to show a console prompt. This very first bracket is not a part of a code. If you are writing these commands in the text editor you do not need to include them as a part of your code.


Here is the code to visualize data from the example above (df). The conceptual progression of steps used to visualize this data is presented in figure format at the end of this section. 

First lets install ggplot2} package to make pretty figures.

> install.packages("ggplot2") # you only need to install any package once 

> library(ggplot2)

### Boxplot

Let's use "ggplot" function to visualize our data using boxplots.

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot package so we can use ggplot() function

ggplot(df, aes(factor(dose), dv)) + # creates empty plot\\
	geom_boxplot() + # to create boxplots on the plot\\
	geom_jitter() # this will visualize every data point on the plot
```



The box plot (a.k.a. box and whisker diagram) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

Line, point, and error bars}

Let's load additional package to help us with error bars.

> install.packages("Rmisc") # you only need to install any package once

Now let's get standard errors for our dataset

```{r}
library(Rmisc) # load Rmisc package so we can use summarySE() function

dfse <- summarySE(df, measurevar="dv", groupvars=c("dose")) # get standard errors for df
dfse # let's see if we got those se (standard errors for each mean)


# Now let's visualize our data using line, point, and error bar.

ggplot(dfse, aes(x=dose, y=dv, group=1)) +
			geom_line() +
			geom_point() +
			geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=dv-se, ymax=dv+se), width=.1)

```



### Barplot

Let's use "ggplot" function to visualize our data using a barplot. We will use the same dataset that includes means for each condition and standard error (se) for each condition (see figures below for more details).

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot package so we can use ggplot() function

ggplot(dfse, aes(x=dose, y=dv)) + 
			geom_bar(stat="identity") +
			geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=dv-se, ymax=dv+se), width=.1)
```



### Saving figures from RStudio

1. To save figure from RStudio: find and click "Export" above the figure.
2. Choose format, destination, and/or size and save.

### Choosing figure format

What is best for my data?

- line connecting points often used for within subjects designs

- boxplots and barplots are often used for between subject designs
